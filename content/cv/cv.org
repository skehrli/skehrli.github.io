* Education
+ BSc in Computer Science from *ETH Zurich* (2021-2024)
+ Exchange student at the *University of Washington* (2023-2024).

* Teaching
+ TA in 'Parallel Programming'. For this one, I wrote a [[https://online.fliphtml5.com/kxggl/swny/][course script]] and received the [[https://inf.ethz.ch/news-and-events/spotlights/infk-news-channel/2023/05/2023-vis-teaching-awards.html][VIS Teaching Award]] for extraordinary commitment as a TA.
+ TA in 'Algorithms & Datastructures'.

* Projects
+ Before starting my undergrad, I was learning about ML algorithms in my free time. To understand neural networks better, I implemented a small neural network library in Python, using only few frameworks and implementing things like backpropagation from scratch, which was a great exercise. Later, during my studies, I added support for CNN's, again with their own backpropagation implementation and rewrote the library in Cython, which transpiles to C for better performance:

+ For a compiler class I wrote a simple, unoptimized compiler for (a large subset of) Java in Java: [[https://github.com/skehrli/MiniJava_compiler][MiniJava Compiler]]

# * Research
# + Designed and implemented an ownership type system for the popular checker framework in Java. Guided by Michael Ernst.
# + Designed and proposed Terminator, a novel Operating System Kernel. Guided by Tom Anderson.
